# This configuration file is used for the in-tree nova driver for powervm.
# These are configuration variables for executing os_ci_tempest.sh
# Not to be confused with tempest.conf, which is copied into the tempest
# installation for execution of tempest itself.

## TEST LIST FILE FORMAT (used for $BLACK_LIST below):
# A test list file should comprise a list of idempotent test UUIDs, one
# per line.
# Blank lines are ignored.
# Lines beginning with "#" are ignored.
# Inline comments are permitted, beginning with "#".
# Example of a valid line (except the leading "#   "):
#   bb5fcead-09b5-484a-bbe6-46d1e06d6cc0 # neutron.tests.tempest.api.test_trunk.TrunkTestJSON.test_add_subport
# Here's a handy sed expression to convert a stestr list output line
# to the above format:
#   sed  's/\([^[]*\).*id-\([[:xdigit:]-]*\).*/\2 # \1/'

# Absolute path to a list of tests to skip. See TEST LIST FILE FORMAT comment
# for a description of the expected file format. The default value is unset.
#BLACK_LIST=
BLACK_LIST=/opt/stack/powervm-ci/tempest/in_tree_blacklist.txt

# Absolute path of the directory in which to store reports from the tempest
# run.  May be overridden by specifying  -o /path/to/reports
#OUTPATH=/opt/stack/logs

# Absolute path to the tempest.conf file to use.  The default value is the
# path of the tempest.conf generated by devstack while stacking.
#TEMPEST_CONF=/opt/stack/tempest/etc/tempest.conf

# Verbose mode (reports e.g. which tests will be run/skipped).  Empty
# means "off".  Nonempty means "on".
#VERBOSE=

# Debug mode (turns on trace).  Empty means "off".  Nonempty means "on".
#DEBUG=

# Location of the tempest repository
#TEMPEST_DIR=/opt/stack/tempest

# The default test timeout of 500 is not long enough for some long running tests
# This increases the timeout to 1000. This may need to be further modified.
