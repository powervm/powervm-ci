# Configuration variables for executing os_ci_tempest.sh
# Not to be confused with tempest.conf, which is copied into the tempest
# installation for execution of tempest itself.

# Baseline tempest test suite.  These tests will be reduced by those
# listed in $skip_list.  Set to '.*' to run all tests.  You can dump
# this list via:
#   cd $TEMPEST_DIR
#   testr list-tests "$BASE_TEST_REGEX"
#BASE_TEST_REGEX='.*'
BASE_TEST_REGEX='(?!.*\[.*\bslow\b.*\])((?!.*test_routers.*))'

# Absolute path of the directory in which to store reports from the tempest
# run.  May be overridden by specifying  -o /path/to/reports
#OUTPATH=/opt/stack/logs

# Absolute path to a list of tests to skip, one per line.  For the
# default value, {config directory} is calculated relative to the path of
# the os_ci_tempest.sh executable.
#SKIP_LIST={config directory}/skip_tests.txt

# Absolute path to the tempest.conf file to use.  For the default value,
# {config directory} is calculated relative to the path of the
# os_ci_tempest.sh executable.
#TEMPEST_CONF={config directory}/tempest.conf

# Verbose mode (reports e.g. which tests will be run/skipped).  Empty
# means "off".  Nonempty means "on".
#VERBOSE=

# Debug mode (turns on trace).  Empty means "off".  Nonempty means "on".
